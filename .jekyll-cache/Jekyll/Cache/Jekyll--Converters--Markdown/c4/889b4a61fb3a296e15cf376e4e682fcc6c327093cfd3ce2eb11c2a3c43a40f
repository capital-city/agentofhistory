<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear reader,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I haven't been blogging in recent months. I don't feel I have much to say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have now moved to Bristol and I and my family are gradually settling in. The legacy of slavery looms large here and has loomed larger in recent years. The controversy of street and building names and, of course, monuments to slave-owners - most notably to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Colston">Edward Colston</a> - has arisen here, not with the overt violence seen in the US, but still with <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/rhodes-must-fall-bristol-university-students-tower-henry-overton-wills-memorial-slave-trade-links-a7655721.html">anger, passion, and division</a>.</p>
